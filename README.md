# PokeDIO - Pok√©mon Game on Ethereum

**PokeDIO** is a decentralized Pok√©mon game built on the Ethereum blockchain using the ERC721 NFT standard. Players can mint unique Pok√©mon, battle them, and level them up based on battle outcomes. This project is designed to run in the Remix IDE, with MetaMask used for wallet integration.

## Overview

In **PokeDIO**, each Pok√©mon is an NFT, and players can interact with the game by minting, owning, and battling their Pok√©mon. The game is managed by the `gameOwner`, who has the exclusive right to mint new Pok√©mon. Players can challenge other Pok√©mon to battles, which affect the level of each participating Pok√©mon.

## Features

- **NFT Pok√©mon**: Each Pok√©mon is represented as an ERC721 token with unique properties.
- **Battles**: Players can battle their Pok√©mon, and depending on the result, their Pok√©mon will gain experience (level).
- **Minting**: The `gameOwner` can mint new Pok√©mon with custom names and images.

## Smart Contract Details

The contract follows the ERC721 standard from OpenZeppelin and is compatible with NFT platforms like OpenSea.

### Contract Structure

- **Pokemon Struct**: Each Pok√©mon has:
  - `name`: A string representing the name of the Pok√©mon.
  - `level`: An integer representing the Pok√©mon's level.
  - `img`: A string (URL) pointing to the Pok√©mon's image.

- **Functions**:
  - `createNewPokemon`: Allows the game owner to create new Pok√©mon.
  - `battle`: Allows Pok√©mon owned by players to battle each other, with leveling mechanics based on battle outcomes.

- **Modifiers**:
  - `onlyOwnerOf`: Ensures only the owner of a Pok√©mon can make it battle.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

To interact with this contract, you'll need:

- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) extension installed in your browser.
- Test Ethereum tokens for deployment and interaction (e.g., from a [faucet](https://faucet.egorfine.com/)).

### Steps to Deploy and Interact

1. **Open Remix IDE**:
   - Go to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
   - Create a new file and paste the smart contract code from this repository.

2. **Compile the Contract**:
   - In Remix, select the appropriate Solidity compiler version (`^0.8.0`).
   - Click on "Compile PokeDIO.sol".

3. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - Under the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab, ensure you have "Injected Web3" selected to connect your MetaMask wallet.
   - Ensure you're connected to a test network in MetaMask (e.g., Ropsten or Goerli).
   - Click "Deploy", and confirm the transaction in MetaMask.

4. **Interacting with the Contract**:
   - Once deployed, the contract functions will be available in Remix under the "Deployed Contracts" section.
   - Use MetaMask to send transactions and interact with the contract.

   - **Mint a Pok√©mon**: 
     As the `gameOwner`, you can create new Pok√©mon:
     ```solidity
     createNewPokemon(string _name, address _to, string _img)
     ```
     Example:
     ```solidity
     createNewPokemon("Pikachu", userAddress, "https://example.com/pikachu.png")
     ```

   - **Battle with Pok√©mon**:
     ```solidity
     battle(uint _attackingPokemon, uint _defendingPokemon)
     ```
     Example:
     ```solidity
     battle(0, 1)
     ```

## Example

### Minting a Pok√©mon

1. In the `createNewPokemon` function, provide the name, recipient address (MetaMask address), and a URL for the Pok√©mon image.
2. Confirm the transaction via MetaMask.

Example:
```solidity
createNewPokemon("Bulbasaur", "0xYourMetaMaskAddress", "https://example.com/bulbasaur.png");
```

## Battling Pok√©mon
To battle two Pok√©mon that exist on the blockchain:

- Select the IDs of the attacking and defending Pok√©mon.
- Confirm the battle and check the levels of both Pok√©mon.

Example:
```solidity
battle(0, 2);
```

## Notes
- MetaMask Integration: MetaMask is used for all transactions, including deploying the contract, minting new Pok√©mon, and battling.
- Gas Fees: All interactions will require gas fees (in ETH), so ensure you have sufficient test Ether in your MetaMask wallet.

## Future Enhancements
- Pok√©mon Types: Introduce type advantages (e.g., Fire vs. Water) to make battles more strategic.
- Evolution: Implement a feature that allows Pok√©mon to evolve when reaching certain levels.
- Trading Platform: Build a decentralized marketplace where players can trade or sell their Pok√©mon.
